# runThisTown

I like to run, and I love maps. 
These two interests led me toward the idea for my first ever full-stack web application - Run This Town.
I designed and built Run This Town from scratch, specifically for joggers interested in recording and reviewing their running activity. 

With the interactive, embedded map, users can plot out new routes by clicking to add waypoints on the map.
Once the route is drawn on the map, it can be named and saved to a database.
Users can view each individual saved route by selecting it from a list.

After going for a jog along the route, users can save the activity as an Outing.
Additionally, users can review past outings.

Run This Town makes use of the following:
    JavaScript,
    Node.js,
    JQuery,
    Bootstrap,
    MapBox,
    MongoDB,
    Heroku
